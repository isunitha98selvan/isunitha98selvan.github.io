I currently work as a Research Engineer at [Patronus AI](https://www.patronus.ai/). I finished my Master's degree from Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/), [Prof. Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) and [Dr. Denis Newman-Griffis](https://www.newman-griffis.org/) during my time at CMU.

I've had the pleasure of interning at: 

+ Allen Institute for AI (AllenNLP team), Summer 2022
+ Microsoft, Summer 2018, 2019

I am a community lead for the AI Safety & Alignment cohort at Cohere for AI. I am a 2018 [Google Women Techmakers Scholar](https://www.womentechmakers.com/scholars). I also volunteered with ACM-W for a while. If you belong to an under-represented community in tech, feel free to reach out to me for any help or mentorship.
