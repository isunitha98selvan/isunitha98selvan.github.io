I am a Master's student at Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently advised by [Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/). I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Carolyn Rose](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cprose/) and [Dr. Denis Newman-Griffis](https://www.newman-griffis.org/) with whom I worked on Medical Word Sense Disambiguation over the past year.

I've had the pleasure of interning at: 

+ Allen Institute for AI (AllenNLP team), Summer 2022
+ Microsoft, Summer 2018, 2019

I am a 2018 [Google Women Techmakers Scholar](https://www.womentechmakers.com/scholars). I also worked with ACM-W as a volunteer for a while. If you belong to an under-represented community in tech, feel free to reach out to me for any help or mentorship.
